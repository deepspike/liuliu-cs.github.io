Liu Liu is currently a Ph.D. student at [Scalable Energy-Efficient Architecture Lab (SEAL)](https://seal.ece.ucsb.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Yuan Xie](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~yuanxie/). His research focuses on efficient deep learning at the intersection between machine learnig and computer architecture. After received his Master’s degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/) from the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), he joined the Department of [Computer Science](http://cs.ucsb.edu/) in 2016. Before his graduate study at UCSB, he received a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](http://www.uestc.edu.cn/)) in 2013.

Research Summary
======
My research interests include hardware specialization for deep learning, heterogeneous computer architecture, ermerging non-volatile memory architecture design. Recent research projects:

Hardware Acceleration for Sparse Neural Networks
------
With the increasing demand on advanced deep learning models, training deep neural networks on large-scale datasets is computationally expensive. However, there exists redundancy in neural network processing. This project aims at exploring efficient methods to select critical neurons which participate in learning the model. Therefore, it could save unnecessary computations as well as intermediate data during training. With hardware support for regular sparsity, this approach could accelerate DNN inference and training significantly. 

Heterogeneous Architecture for Robotics
------
Emerging robotic applications pose challenges to current computing platforms with stringent real-time requirements and limited energy budget. This project explores a heterogeneous SoC architecture by integrating GPU, DSP, and FPGA.  

Emerging NVM-based Cache Design
------
This project proposes to deploy data compression schemes on multi-level cell STT-MRAM based last-level cache to reduce energy consumption without system performance degradation.
